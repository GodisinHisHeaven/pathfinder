## Week 1

### Goals:

* Setup our BFS traversal
* Write test cases for our BFS traversal
* Debug
* Implement Graph and file I/O

### Tasks:

#### xudongx2:

* Graph data structure and file I/O for loading data to memory

#### mingjun6:

* BFS traversal

#### kcm3:

* ~~KNN implementation~~

#### yihengn2:

* Have a good rest

### Encountered Problems:

* Decision of algorithm adding

### Next Week's Plan:

* Finish the BFS
* Finish the Graph data structure and file I/O

## Week 2

### Goals:
