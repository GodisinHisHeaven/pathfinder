### Comments
You have fixed the main issue by including a third algorithm, but there are a few minor problems. As I mentioned before, I think you could be more specific about what your array is storing (e.g. airport metadata, airport IDs, etc.). 

As for the algorithm you have included, there are certain details which are not mentioned. For example, are you projecting the entire graph dataset onto a map or just the shortest path? If you are projecting the dataset, then why is a shortest path required as input? If you are projecting the shortest path, then the time complexity doesn't seem correct.

Other than that, your revised proposal looks good and is approved.
