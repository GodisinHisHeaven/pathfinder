Your group has made good progress in the past week and seems on track, no real concerns. I like that you have clearly organized your log into different sections.

It seems that you have completed the graph data structure and dataset parsing, as well as the BFS algorithm. This looks great in terms of progress. In preparation for the mid-project check-in meeting next week, don't forget to write test cases for your algorithms and your graph data structure, since this will be looked at during the meeting. Good job otherwise.
