# Development Log Feedback


## Week of 3/28 - 4/3


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
Your group has made good progress in the past week and seems on track, no real concerns. I like that you have clearly organized your log into different sections.


## Week of 4/4 - 4/10


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
It seems that you have completed the graph data structure and dataset parsing, as well as the BFS algorithm. This looks great in terms of progress. In preparation for the mid-project check-in meeting next week, don't forget to write test cases for your algorithms and your graph data structure, since this will be looked at during the meeting. Good job otherwise.

## Week of 4/11 - 4/17


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
Not many comments for this week; progress looks good. If you have BFS completed, then you'll find that Dijkstra's algorithm will end up being very structurally similar. I will also repeat the sentiment from last week: make sure to include test cases for your algorithms and graph data structure/parsing before the check-in meeting.
